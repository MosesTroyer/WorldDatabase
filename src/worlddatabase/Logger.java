 * Class: Logger
 * Description: This writes to the log.txt file, Solves the problems 
 * with trying to open buffered readers in each class. 
 *  At this point it's just way more convenient for me to use this every time
 *  instead of fiddling around with writing to the log file every project
 *  I need to
